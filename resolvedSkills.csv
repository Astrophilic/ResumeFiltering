class Classification of 
Biomedical data to find Protein/Gene Interaction
 
  
 

 
Adapted and deployed several Natural Language Processing concepts such as POS tagging, Named Entity

etc.
 
to 
determine context words in sentence
 

 
Hosted UMLS database containing genes and proteins on local SQL server and established 
its
 
connection with Python 
to eliminate those sentences which do not contain protein or gene names, thereby improving data quality  
 

 
Produced word embeddings on processe
d dataset using one

hot encoding
 
and Word2Vec
 
 

 
Built 2 deep learning models, one with Convolutional Neural 
Networks (
CNN) and another with combination of both 
Recurrent Neural Networks
 
(R
